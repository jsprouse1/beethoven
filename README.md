E-portfolio

Type
Individual or groups of up to 3 members
Description
Create an E-portfolio of a celebrity or a fictitious person. The minimum requirements are:
•	5 web pages with the home page called index.html; the other pages are background, resume, projects and contact.
•	An external style sheet called mystyle.css that is referenced by all pages.
•	Each page should have a different main image.
•	Each HTML document should have a head and body.
o	Head. It should contain a title and a link to the CSS file.
o	Body. It should have a title inside <h1> tag, a menu inside the <nav> tag, a <section> area with content specific to each page and a <footer>.  
	The <section> area should use <h2> tags whenever possible, use unordered lists and/or detail list to display background. At least 1 page should use a detailed list. Also, some text should have their own style by using the span tag with a class applied.
	The footer area should display copyright information, the year and all the authors. It should also have hyperlinks to the websites from which your site copied any images files used.
•	The CSS file should contain style rules that are good for all pages of the website. The styles should be applied to body, h1, h2, ul, dl, nav, section, div, footer, etc. It should also contain at least 1 class to emphasize text. The background color should be different than the section and menus. When the user hovers over a particular menu item, the target menu item should display a different shading and larger text. Also, the menu item corresponding to the current page should be larger and have a different shading than the rest.
•	The entire website should follow the same color scheme and be congruent with the person featured in the E-portfolio. For instance, if the person featured is an artist, the color scheme should be different than that of a businessman. 
•	IMPORTANT! The website’s structure should closely match the one shown in the sample section.
